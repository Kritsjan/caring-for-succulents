                    <h2>The Biggest Watering Mistakes That Kill Succulents</h2>
                    
                    <p>Here's what nobody tells you about watering succulents: they're not actually that hard to keep alive. You're just probably doing one of these things:</p>

                    <div class="mistake-box">
                        <h3>1. Watering on a Schedule</h3>
                        <p>Look, your succulent doesn't care what day of the week it is. It needs water when it needs water. Period. Use our <a href="../tools/plant-watering-calculator.html">watering calculator</a> instead of your calendar.</p>
                        
                        <p>Here's what matters more than schedules:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Soil moisture level</li>
                            <li>Current season and growth phase</li>
                            <li>Indoor temperature and humidity</li>
                            <li>Amount of light the plant receives</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>

                    <div class="mistake-box">
                        <h3>2. Misting Instead of Soaking</h3>
                        <p>Misting is like giving your succulent a sip when it needs a proper drink. These are desert plants - they're built for drought followed by downpours.</p>
                        
                        <p>What happens when you mist:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Roots stay shallow instead of growing deep</li>
                            <li>Water collects on leaves, risking rot</li>
                            <li>Plant never gets enough water to thrive</li>
                            <li>Creates false sense of proper watering</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>

                    <div class="mistake-box">
                        <h3>3. Watering the Leaves Instead of the Soil</h3>
                        <p>Water on leaves = rot. Simple as that. Get the water where it needs to go: the roots.</p>
                        
                        <p>Why this kills plants:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Creates perfect environment for fungal growth</li>
                            <li>Water pools in leaf joints and crown</li>
                            <li>Leads to stem rot that travels down</li>
                            <li>Damages the protective coating on leaves</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>

                    <div class="pro-tip">
                        <strong>Reality Check:</strong> If you're watering more than once a week, you're probably doing it wrong. Less is more with succulents. I've seen plants thrive on monthly watering when conditions are right.

                                Overwatering is the number one cause of succulent death. These desert plants are adapted to survive in arid conditions and store water in their leaves. When you water them too frequently, their roots sit in wet soil, leading to root rot.

                    <p>Here's my exact process, developed after years of trial and error:</p>

                    <ol class="step-list">
                        <li><strong>Check the soil:</strong> Stick your finger in it. If it's even slightly damp, wait.</li>
                        <li><strong>Water deeply:</strong> Pour water until it runs out the drainage holes.</li>
                        <li><strong>Let it drain:</strong> Never let your pot sit in water. Ever.</li>
                        <li><strong>Wait:</strong> Don't water again until the soil is bone dry.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <div class="pro-tip">
                        <strong>Pro Move:</strong> Get the right pot size using our <a href="../tools/pot-volume-calculator.html">pot calculator</a>. Wrong pot size = wrong water retention = dead plant.

                            <li>Let plant dry out for 2-3 days</li>
                            <li>Replant in completely dry, fresh soil</li>
